VS Code Stuff:
## pip freeze > file_name to set requirements (virtual environment)
## always use virtual environment - keeps versions the same so the code won't be broken using extensions
## open model folder directly rather than single file
## use launch json file to always launch model rather than the other files
## can use a config json file too to have all the numbers in
## keep main model file outside of the PhD_Work folder as it causes problems with git
## breakpoints- using F10 and F11 to step through code
## good practice to define data types for all variables
## also do the """ """ commenting for all methods


To do:
## Solar wind variations - change flaring: do this when doing 3D VER results?
## Make plotter class
## Moon class update
## New magnetopause - keep old file though
## Important files like ACE data from other folder - again do when sheath is done
## Neutrals x-z projection - do it!!!

For meeting (25th Nov):
Plotter class [DONE]
Moon class update
Magnetopause update
Code up sheath stuff (even though not working)
Neutrals projection [DONE]
