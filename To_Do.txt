VS Code Stuff:
## pip freeze > file_name to set requirements (virtual environment)
## always use virtual environment - keeps versions the same so the code won't be broken using extensions
## open model folder directly rather than single file
## use launch json file to always launch model rather than the other files
## can use a config json file too to have all the numbers in
## keep main model file outside of the PhD_Work folder as it causes problems with git
## breakpoints- using F10 and F11 to step through code
## good practice to define data types for all variables
## also do the """ """ commenting for all methods


To do:
## Solar wind variations - change flaring: do this when doing 3D VER results?
## Make plotter class [DONE]
## Moon class update {DONE}
## New magnetopause - keep old file though [DONE]
## Important files like ACE data from other folder - again do when sheath is done 
## Neutrals x-z projection - do it!!! [DONE]

For meeting (25th Nov):
Plotter class [DONE]
Moon class update [DONE]
Magnetopause update [DONE]
Code up sheath stuff (even though not working) [DONE]
Neutrals projection [DONE]
Reorganise files [DONE]

Meeting: ask about tomorrow's meeting and also about next week's supervisor meeting.

Add exosphere* [DONE]
Other projection for neutrals* 
Other projection for sheath*
VER results*: if any results for Friday, could take to MIST?
Continue with Saturn paper:
    - Combine some figures
    - Link back to SMILE at Earth
    - Make sure point source graph is correct
Sort out grid limits etc.
Tidy up code? Make sure all functions commented properly
Set Sheath density*
SW variations: change flaring
MIST: name badge* [DONE]
Any unused code can be put in a separate file? Comment where it came from
Sort out import file
Neutrals: moons orbit in equatorial plane*

Maybe take slice of the magnetopause and bow shock too? Just so I know the sheath fits?
Make sure code is suitable to be used at other planets

For next meeting:
- sheath density
- VER results
- neutrals projection
-
