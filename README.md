# Soft X-Ray Emission from Uranus's Magnetosheath

This models simulates charge exchange-driven soft x-ray emission within Uranus's magnetosheath. It considers a simple bullet-shaped magnetopause and bow shock and a much simplified configuration to the reality at Uranus. It is the first step in developing an detailed model of emission to determine the viability of sending an SXI along with the planned Uranus flagship mission.
